# ApacheS

With this script, while creating AWS EC2 machines, we will install ApacheServer while installing the machine in the 'UserData' field.

You can do this manually or by typing in the 'UserData' section in the CloudFormation template.

Or it is possible to do it from any remote access and access sources.

"yum" applies to AmazonLinux machines.

"httpd" <-- Apache Server.

By processing HTML and similar codes taken from the site, we set up a Web Server.
