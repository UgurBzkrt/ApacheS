With this script, during the creation of AWS EC2 machines, we will raise the server while the machine is installed in the 'UserData' field.

You can do this manually or by typing in the 'UserData' section in the CloudFormation template.

Or it is possible to do it from any remote access and access sources.

"yum" applies to AmozonLinux machines.
